Château de Brissac, Brissac-Quincé, France 
  </h1>



<h2 style="font-size:20px; ">
One of the tallest castles in all of France, the seven-story Château de Brissac is perhaps best known as the home of "The Green Lady," aka the ghost of Charlotte of France. The chateau's website tells the legend of Charlotte, the illegitimate daughter of King Charles VII, who was murdered by her husband after he discovered her having an affair. Named for the color of her dress when she was killed, the Green Lady can be found roaming the chapel's tower room and moaning in the early hours of morning.
